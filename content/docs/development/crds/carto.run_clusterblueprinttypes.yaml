  # Description describes this output to provide documentation to

  description: <string>

  # Qualifier is provided to avoid name collisions when blueprint
  # authors start creating new types on a platform. There is a
  # validation rule that metadata.name must be of the form:
  # <qualifier>.<name> or <qualifier>-<name>. If the qualifier is
  # omitted, then just <name> will suffice. Note: For TAP, this
  # should be "tap" to avoid collisions with blueprint authors. We
  # recommend other platforms follow this pattern also.
  # +optional
  qualifier: <string>

  # Schema a JSON schema that is a valid representation of a type.
  # Due to a limitation in k8s CRD definitions, this field accepts
  # any valid JSON, however the validation will fail if it's not
  # JSONSchema as per apiextensions.JSONSchemaProps (see:
  # https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions@v0.24.2#JSONSchemaProps)
  # Todo: explain the problem with the absence of schema here, and
  # semantic error checking
  schema: <any>

  # Schemas represent named subschemas, great for using with
  # openapi $ref syntax, especially in oneOf, anyOf, allOf etc
  # expressions. See:
